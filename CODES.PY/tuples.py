#tuples are similar to lists. However, tuples are immutable. 

tuple1=("Arjun", 57000, "IT department")
print(tuple1)
name,sal,dep=tuple1
print(name)
print(sal)
print(dep)
mix=(" arjun",[90,88,75],("maths", "science"," social"))
print(mix)
print(mix[0][3])
print(mix[1][1])
print(mix + tuple1)

for i in tuple1 :
   print("members are", i)
s=( {1,2,4}, [3,6,8], (9,10,11) )
print(s)
# To convert tuple to list 
Tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
l = list(Tup)
